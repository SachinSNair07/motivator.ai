Believe you can and you're halfway there.
Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you.
Dream it. Wish it. Do it.
Success doesn’t come to you, you have to go to it.
Don’t stop when you’re tired. Stop when you’re done.
Hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard.
Stay positive, work hard, make it happen.
The harder you work for something, the greater you’ll feel when you achieve it.
You don’t have to be perfect to be amazing.
If you want something you’ve never had, you must be willing to do something you’ve never done.
